Miso Shiitake Tofu Nuggets, 9/21

1/2lb extra firm tofu, drained & crumbled
1/2lb shiitake mushroom caps, cleaned and roughly chopped

3tbsp red miso paste
3tbsp finely chopped green onion
1tsp sesame oil
3tbsp edamame, steamed or otherwise cooked (but still firm)

Flour & panko for coating
Veg oil for frying

1) Saute green onion in sesame oil
2) Mix tofu, onions, shroom caps, miso together, pref. in a food processor.
3) Once mixture is a paste, remove from processor. Add edamame.
4) Form mixture into 9-ish patty-ball-nugget type shapes.
5) Dredge in flour, then press into panko.
6) Fry in 1 inch of 340F oil, or enough to cover the nuggets. Once both sides
are golden brown, remove and drain.

NOTES:
This recipe currently has problems. Consistency of tofu mixture is far too
loose, and the edamame interrupts the binding. Consider chopping edamame, or
adding a binder/filler.

Texture is less than ideal, almost like toothpaste. Needs firmness.

Miso is a little overwhelming. Consider cutting back by 1tbsp, reevaluate.

Fresh ginger, sauteed with the onions, may be a welcome addition.
