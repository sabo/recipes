BAGUETTES MK. 1
===============

Makes around 4 18-inch baguettes
#For the preferment
* 400g bread flour
* 400g lukewarm water
* 1/8 tsp highly active yeast

#For the dough
* 450g bread flour
* 150g hard whole wheat flour
* 350g lukewarm water
* 3 tsp table salt
* 2 tbsp highly active yeast

Instructions:
1. Mix together the ingredients for the poolish. Cover with plastic wrap. 
Let sit at room temp. for 14-16 hours. Alternatively, reduce the amount of
yeast, let sit at room temp for 2 hours, then refridgerate for up to two days.
After removing from fridge, let sit at room temp for another two hours.

2. Add yeast to 350g water.

3. When water-yeast starts to bubble, add to poolish, and mix in remaining
ingredients. Knead or use the dough hook in a mixer to incorporate and knead
the dough to a smooth and elastic mass. Add to proofing container. Let sit for
1.5 hours.

4. After 1.5 hours, turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Fold 4 times.
Return dough to container and let sit for another 1.5 hours.

5. After first ferment completes, divide dough into quarters. Shape into
baguettes or whatever you please. Preheat oven as high as it will go. Let
loaves sit for 40-45 minutes or until poking the dough leaves an indent that
doesn't spring back immediately.

6. Boil some water. Add crappy pan to bottom of oven and let it heat up. Set
oven to 475 degrees F, add baguettes, and pour boiling water into crappypan.
CLOSE THE FUCKING DOOR AND DON'T EVEN LOOK AT IT FOR 15 MINUTES.

7. After 15 minutes, rotate/swap pans as befits your situation to encourage
even baking. Give them another 15.

8. Remove and let cool.

##NOTES 3/10/14
Crumb could be more open. Possibly overworked dough. Try mixing by hand next
time. Crust browns better on the top rack.
