### Recipe
Dough:

* 1 1/2 cups warm water
* 2 1/4 tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast
* 1 tsp granulated sugar
* 2 tsp salt
* 3 tsp coconut or unrefined peanut oil
* 1/4 cup honey
* 1 whole egg
* 1 egg yolk
* 4 1/2 cups unbleached all purpose flour

Boiling water:
* 1 tbsp baking soda
* 1/3 cup honey

* A fair amount of poppy and/or sesame seeds.

In a bowl, stir yeast, sugar, 1/4 cup honey, and warm water together.
Cover with a kitchen towel and let sit for 5-7 minutes, until bubbles appear. 
Next, pour salt, oil, egg and the yolk into the bowl of yeast, whisk until combined.
Pour in 1 cup of the flour and stir until incorporated.

Put the remaining 3 cups of flour into a separate, large bowl.
Add the yeasty batter to the flour, mix until it forms into a sticky, shaggy dough.
Place dough in sealed container, and put in the fridge. Let sit for 24-48 hours.
Fold every 12 hours or so.

After the cold ferment has completed, remove and let sit for 2-3 hours in
warmish draft-free area to bring it back up to temperature. Divide into 18
equal parts.

Carefully stretch and roll the pieces until they are 6-8 inches in length.
Pinch ends together to make a sort of donut shape. Cover and let rise for 20
minutes.

Put a rack in the center of the oven and one at the bottom. Put some large
heavy pot/skillet, preferably something like cast iron, on the bottom rack.
Preheat oven to 500 degress. Bring 16 cups of water to a boil. Add baking soda and honey.
Reduce heat to a simmer.

Boil each bagel for one minute at a time on each side. Do this in batches.
As you remove each bagel from the water, press into poppy or sesame seeds 
(the correct answer is sesame seeds) and place on a baking sheet with parchment
paper. As the bagels are boiling, bring a teapot of water to a boil.

When the bagels have finished boiling, put them in the oven, pour the boiling
tea kettle of water into the pot or skillet (WATCH FOR STEAM) then CLOSE THE
DOOR. Bake for 10-12 minutes, then flip and bake for 5 more. Watch to make sure
they don't overcook.


### Notes

Decent flavor, but kind of donutesque texture on the outside. Not really
mailliard'ed crust. Possible causes:
* Baking soda in boil water. Consider omitting.
* Boil water too hot.
