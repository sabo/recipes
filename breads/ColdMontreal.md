Cold-ferment Montreal-style bagels
==================================
### Recipe
Dough:

* 440ml warm water
* 2 1/4 tsp (1 packet) active dry yeast
* 15g salt
* 80ml honey
* 2 lg eggs
* 370g bread flour
* 370g all-purpose flour
* 185g whole wheat flour

Boiling water:
* 1/3 cup honey

Toppings:
* A fair amount of poppy and/or sesame seeds.

In a bowl, stir yeast, honey, and warm water together.
Cover with a kitchen towel and let sit for 5-7 minutes, until bubbles appear. 
Next add eggs into the bowl of yeast, whisk until combined.
Pour in 1 cup of the flour and stir until incorporated.

Put the remaining flour into a separate, large bowl. Add salt & mix.
Add the yeasty batter to the flour, mix until it forms into a sticky, shaggy dough.
Place dough in sealed container, and put in the fridge. Let sit for 24-48 hours.
Slap-and-fold every 12 hours or so.

After the cold ferment has completed, remove and let sit for 1.5 hours in
warmish draft-free area to bring it back up to temperature.
Divide into 18 equal parts -- should be about 85g apiece.

Carefully stretch and roll the pieces until they are 8-10 inches in length.
Pinch ends together to make a sort of torus, or "donut" shape. Cover and
let rise for 20 minutes.

Put a rack in the center of the oven and one at the bottom.
Preheat oven to 500 degress. Bring 16 cups of water to a boil.
Add honey. Reduce heat to a simmer.

Boil each bagel for one minute at a time on each side. Do this in batches.
As you remove each bagel from the water, press into poppy or sesame seeds 
(the correct answer is sesame seeds) and place on a baking sheet with parchment
paper.

Use a water pan if you want, but pull it out after ~10 minutes of steam baking.
Bake for 15 minutes, then flip and bake for 5 more.  Bake more if necessary, until the
bagels start to develop a browning.
