## Ingredients
* 361g all-purpose flour, divided (20 and 341g)
* 35g potato flour or dry potato flakes
* 35g dry milk
* 25g sugar
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 57g unsalted butter
* 297g lukewarm water, divided (100g and 197g)


## Steps:
### Tangzhong
1. Combine 20g flour and 100g water in a saucepan. Whisk to combine.
2. Cook mixture, whisking constantly, over medium high heat, until it forms a thick
slurry.
3. Transfer slurry to bowl. Let cool until lukewarm.

### Dough
4. Add slurry to the rest of the ingredients in a mixer bowl. Mix using paddle
attachment until combined.
5. Switch to dough hook. Knead at KA speed 2 for 3-4 minutes, until it forms a soft dough.
6. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it's almost doubled in bulk.
7. Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.
8. Place the balls into the greased cups of a hamburger bun pan, flattening gently. Or place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving about 2" to 3" between them; flatten gently.
9. Cover and let rise until the buns have doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
10. If desired, add an egg wash and some sesame seeds or other topping.
11. Bake the buns for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they're light golden brown.
12. Remove them from the oven, and brush them with melted butter, if desired.
13. Transfer the buns to a rack to cool. Store buns, well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.
