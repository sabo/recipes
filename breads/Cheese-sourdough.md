# Sourdough with little bits of cheese in it and also some rosemary

based on Peter Beinart's basic sourdough, from "The Bread Baker's Apprentice" pp. 233-235

## Ingredients
### Firm starter
* 4oz (115g) sourdough starter
* 4.5oz (128g) bread flour
* 1 to 2 oz (28-56g) water

### Final dough
* 20.25 oz (575g) bread flour
* 0.5 oz (14g) salt
* 12-14oz (340-396g) water
* 140-280g cheese, in tiny cubes or otherwise small chunks
  (type and amount of cheese to taste, if it's a salty cheese cut the salt to ~10g)
* A few sprigs-worth of fresh rosemary leaves, don't pull the leaves until you're adding
    them, chop lightly just before mixing

## Steps
### Building the firm starter (Day 1, afternoon)
1. Mix the sourdough starter and flour together. Add just enough water to get the dough to
   feel right. Knead briefly, just long enough to get everything homogenous. You're aiming 
   for a stiff dough, should feel maybe tacky but not sticky or too soft. 
1. Place starter inside a lightly-oiled and covered bowl. Ferment until the starter has
   doubled in size, usually about 4 hours.
1. Put it in the fridge overnight. (You could also maybe let it go a day longer.)

### Making the dough (Day 2, morning)
1. Take starter out of the fridge. Cut or tear it into about 10 pieces, then mist the
   pieces with oil and let them sit covered for an hour to warm up.
1. When your starter has been out for long enough, chop the rosemary. 
   Mix together the rest of the flour, the salt, and the rosemary.
   Add the starter pieces and mix in enough water to bring everything together into a ball.
1. Transfer to a floured work surface and knead by hand, 12-15 minutes. Again, you want a
   firm, tacky-but-not-sticky dough.
1. At the end of the kneading process, flatten the dough out a bit. Sprinkle 1/3 of your
   cheese on it, roll it back up and knead it back into a ball. Repeat until you've used
   all your cheese.
1. Put dough in a large oiled and covered bowl. Ferment until the dough has nearly doubled
   (3-4 hours).
1. Shape the dough however you like. Rolls are fun, so's a big ol boule.
1. Proof dough, covered and oiled appropriately, for 2-3 hours or overnight in the fridge. (If
   overnight, take out 4 hours before baking)

### Baking (Day 2, afternoon or day 3, morning)
1. Preheat oven to 500F/260C. Rack in the middle, a baking stone or steel if you have it. 
   Put a steam pan (can be a junky old rimmed baking sheet) at the bottom of the oven.
1. 10 minutes before baking, uncover the proofed bread and put a kettle of water on to
   boil.
1. Put the bread on the back of a sheet-pan well-dusted with semolina or cornmeal. If your preferred
   bread shape needs slashing, do so. Put the bread in the oven, either by sliding onto a
   baking stone/steel or baking on the sheet-pan. Pour boiling water into the steam pan
   (WATCH FOR THE STEAM) then close the oven.
1. After 30 seconds, open the door briefly to spray the bread and oven walls with water.
   Repeat 2 more times at 30 second intervals.
1. Reduce oven to 450F/230C. Bake for 10 minutes. Rotate, if needed for even baking.
   Bake 10-20 minutes more, until they hit 205F/96C in the center, are a golden brown, and
   sound hollow when you tap the bottom.
1. Let cool 1hr before serving.
