## Ingredients
Some of these specific flour blends are hard to come by. I had light rye flour and dark rye flour. When the recipe calls for "medium rye" I used a 50/50 blend.
When it calls for "coarse meal" I just used dark. There's probably some textural difference, but eh.

For the rye malt powder, get some whole rye malt from a homebrew store. Toast it in a skillet until
it's pink to reddish-brown. Grind it up and sift it with a fine mesh screen.

For the rye starter, take a regular sourdough starter and do two feedings: the first,
replacing half of the flour used to feed it with rye; the second with all rye. Assuming
you're throwing out half at each stage, that gets you to almost pure rye starter without
much waste.

I used blackstrap instead of dark molasses. I've heard people say they aren't substitutes for each
other. People are cowards.

## Steps

### Day one, evening
1. Mix the sponge ingredients by hand. Let ferment overnight. It should double in volume.
   It's sourdough, so it'll smell sour, but in a good way.

1. Mix the scald ingredients. Don't do it by hand, the water is boiling ffs. Let sit
   overnight.

### Day two, morning
1. Combine the scald and the sponge in a mixer. Mix until...mixed. Cover the mixer bowl and let ferment
   at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 3-4 hours.

### Day two, afternoon
1. Add the flours, salt, malt powder, and molasses to the mixer bowl with the scald-sponge
   in it. Use the dough hook on a low speed for 8-10 minutes, until the dough is smooth,
   soft, and uniformly brown. Cover and ferment until expanded, at least 60 minutes.

1. Spoon the dough into a well-greased 9x4x4 inch Pullman loaf pan. Wet your hands and
   distribute the dough evenly, leaving the top smooth and flat. Dribble about a
   tablespoon of water over the top, to keep it moist. Cover and proof at room temperature
   until the loaf shows broken bubbles on the top, 1.5-2 hours.

1. Brush again with water, and garnish with crushed coriander.

1. Near the end of the proofing period, set a rack in the center of your oven. If you have
   a baking stone, use it if you want. In the bottom of the oven, put a sheet pan or
   something similar that you don't particularly care about. (This will be a steam tray,
   you will pour boiling water into it just before you put the bread in. This may cause it
   to warp, perhaps permanently. Great use for a $1 garage sale pan.) 
   Preheat the oven to 550F, or as hot as your oven will go. Get some boiling water ready.

1. Pour the boiling water into your steam tray, and put the loaf in. Bake with steam at
   550F for 10 minutes. Remove the steam tray, cover the loaf with aluminum foil, and
   reduce the oven temperature to 350F. Bake for 45-50 minutes. Pull out the Pullman pan,
   pull the loaf from the Pullman loaf pan, and return the loaf to the oven to get the
   sides and bottom a little more colorwater into your steam tray, and put the loaf in.
   Bake with steam at 550F for 10 minutes. Remove the steam tray, cover the loaf with
   aluminum foil, and reduce the oven temperature to 350F. Bake for 45-50 minutes. Pull
   out the Pullman pan, pull the loaf from the Pullman loaf pan, and return the loaf to
   the oven to get the sides and bottom a little more color. Bake until the loaf makes a
   thump sound when you tap it on the bottom and the internal temperature measures at
   least 198F, 10-15m. Transfer to a rack and let cool completely before slicing.
