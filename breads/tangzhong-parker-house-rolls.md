## Ingredients

* 3 cups (360g) All-Purpose Flour, divided (20g, 340)
* 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
* 3 tablespoons (39g) sugar
* 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* 1/4 cup (50g) potato flour or 3/4 cup (50g) dried potato flakes
* 3 tablespoons (43g) butter
* 1.35 cup (308g) milk, divided (100g, 208g)
* 1 large egg
* 3 1/2 to 4 tablespoons (50g to 57g) butter, melted; for brushing on rolls


## Directions
1. Take the 20g of flour and 100g of milk and tangzhong it. Add the milk and flour to a small saucepan over medium heat, whisking them together. Stir constantly, until it starts to thicken and form a paste -- should only take a minute.

1. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients (except the 3 1/2 to 4 tablespoons (50 to 57g) melted butter at the end), mixing to form a shaggy dough.

1. Knead the dough, by hand (10 minutes) or by machine (7 to 8 minutes) until it's smooth.

1. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or 8-cup measure (so you can track its rising progress). Allow it to rise for 90 minutes; it'll become quite puffy, though it probably won't double in bulk. 

1. Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface. Divide it in half. Working with one half at a time, roll or pat the dough into an 8" x 12" rectangle.

1. Cut the dough in half lengthwise, to make two 4" x 12" rectangles. Working with one rectangle at a time, fold it lengthwise to about 1/2" of the other edge, so the bottom edge sticks out about 1/2" beyond the top edge. You'll now have a rectangle that's about 2 1/4" x 12". Repeat with the other piece of dough.

1. Cut each of the rectangles crosswise into four 3" pieces, making a total of 8 folded rolls, each about 2 1/4" x 3". Flip the rolls over (so that their smooth non-folded side is facing up), and place them in a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan. Repeat with the remaining piece of dough, making 16 rolls in all. You'll arrange 4 rows of 4 in the pan, with the longer side of the rolls going down the longer side of the pan. Gently flatten the rolls to pretty much cover the bottom of the pan.

1. Cover the pan, and let the rolls proof just overnight in the fridge. 

1. The next morning, pull the rolls out an hour before baking to let the chill come
   off.

1. Brush the dough all over with a light coating of the melted butter. You'll have butter left over; you'll need it for the other half of the dough, as well as for brushing on top of the baked rolls.
1. preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

1. Bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes, until they're golden brown and feel set.

1. Remove them from the oven, and brush with the remaining melted butter. Pull them apart to serve.
