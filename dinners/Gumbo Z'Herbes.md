Original recipe: Vegan Soul Kitchen
Ingredients: 
Coarse sea salt
1 large bunch mustard greens, chopped
1 large bunch collard greens, chopped
1 large bunch kale, chopped
1 large bunch spinach, chopped
½ cup extra-virgin olive oil
7 garlic cloves, minced
½ cup whole wheat pastry flour
2 large yellow onions, diced
2 large red bell peppers, diced
2 celery ribs, halved and chopped
¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
6 cups vegetable stock
1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
1 teaspoon filé powder
1 tablespoon “hot” apple cider vinegar
2 large scallions, thinly sliced for garnish

Directions: 
1. In a large pot bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon of salt.

2. Add leafy greens to the boiling water and cook uncovered for 3 to 4 minutes.
Drain in a colander and cool. Transfer greens to a cutting board and chop well.

3. Heat W cup of olive oil in a sauté pan over medium heat and sauté garlic
until golden. Add the greens, raise the heat to high, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon
of salt, and sauté, stirring occasionally, for 2 to 3 minutes, until well
coated with oil. Set aside.

4. In a large pot over low heat, combine the flour and the remaining olive oil
and cook, stirring often, until caramel colored, about 25 minutes. Add the
onions, bell peppers, celery, cayenne pepper, and ½ teaspoon of salt. Raise the
heat to medium and sauté, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften,
about 15 minutes. Slowly stir in the vegetable stock. Add the reserved greens,
bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until greens are
tender, about 45 minutes.

5. Stir in the thyme and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in the
filé and the hot apple cider vinegar, and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.

Ingredients
For the greens:

    5 bunches greens, such as collard greens, chicory, dandelion greens, mustard greens, spinach, parsley, beet tops, carrot tops, or turnip tops (enough to equal about 3 pounds)
    3 cups water

For the gumbo base:

    2/3 cup vegetable oil
    2/3 cup all-purpose flour
    1 medium yellow onion, medium dice
    1 bunch scallions, white and light green parts thinly sliced, green tops reserved for garnish
    1 large green bell pepper, medium dice
    4 celery stalks, medium dice
    1 large garlic clove, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
    2 cups water or low-sodium vegetable broth
    2 teaspoons kosher salt
    2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (either purchased or homemade)
    2 whole cloves
    3 allspice berries
    2 dried bay leaves
    1 tablespoon minced marjoram leaves
    Green Tabasco

For the greens:

    1 Rinse and trim the greens, removing any dried-out parts or tough stems
that don’t break easily. If you’re using collards, remove the tough inner rib
that runs up the center of each leaf.  2 Fill the sink with cold water and
submerge all the greens. Leave undisturbed for about 5 minutes, then lift from
the water and place in a colander. (Don’t drain the sink with the greens still
in it: Soaking the greens allows all the sand and grit to settle to the bottom
of the sink—if you drain it, your greens are left sitting in the silty stuff.)
If necessary, repeat this process.  3Chop or tear the greens into large pieces
and place in a large saucepan or pot with a tightfitting lid. Add water
andseason generously with salt; place over medium-high heat. When the water in
the pot begins to simmer, tightly cover and reduce the heat to medium low. Cook
the greens, occasionally turning with a pair of tongs, until they are very soft
and wilted, about 15 to 20 minutes.  4Strain the greens, being sure to reserve
the cooking liquid. (You should have about 3 1/2 cups.) Allow the greens to
cool slightly, then chop them into 1/2-inch pieces. Take about half of the
chopped greens and purée them in a food processor or blender (if the greens
will not blend, add a little of the reserved cooking liquid to help them
along); set aside.

For the gumbo base:

    1In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over
medium heat. When it is hot, slowly sprinkle in the flour, stirring constantly
with a wire whisk to prevent any lumps from forming. Reduce the heat to medium
low and cook the roux, stirring constantly (and taking care to scrape out the
corners of the pan), until it is a nutty brown color (the color of peanut
butter) and emits a toasted aroma, about 10 to 15 minutes.  2Use a wooden spoon
to stir the onion, scallions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic into the pot.
Season with a pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cook, stirring
often, until the vegetables are softened and the garlic is no longer
raw-smelling, about 5 minutes.  3Add the reserved cooking liquid along with the
vegetable broth or water, stirring well to incorporate. Increase the heat to
medium high and bring the mixture to a simmer. Stir in the measured salt, Cajun
seasoning, cloves, allspice, and bay leaves and simmer, stirring often, until
the gumbo base is soupy and thick and the vegetables are tender, about 15
minutes.  4Stir in the chopped and puréed greens and marjoram; cover the pot
and simmer 10 minutes. Add Tabasco to taste and serve over cooked white rice,
garnished with thinly sliced scallion tops.

Ingredients

    1 cup peanut oil, lard or other vegetable oil
    1 cup flour
    2 cups chopped onion
    1 cup chopped green bell pepper
    1 cup chopped celery
    4 cloves garlic
    2 bay leaves
    1 Tbsp Cajun seasoning (see below)
    1 ham hock (optional)
    10 cups water
    3 pounds assorted greens (i.e. kale, collards, mustard greens, turnip greens, spinach, chard, parsley, dandelion greens, beet greens), chopped (about 14 cups)
    Salt
    1 pound smoked andouille sausage (optional)
    File powder to taste (optional)

Cajun Spice Blend

    1 teaspoon black pepper
    1 teaspoon cayenne
    1 teaspoon celery seed
    1 teaspoon dried thyme
    2 teaspoons dried oregano
    1 Tbsp garlic powder
    2 Tbsp sweet paprika

1 Start the gumbo by making a roux, which will add a lot of flavor and thicken the gumbo. Heat the cup of peanut oil or lard (both are traditional roux ingredients) over medium heat for a minute or two and then stir in the flour. Mix so there are no lumps. Cook the roux over medium-low heat until it is the color of chocolate. It is your choice how dark you let your roux go: The darker it is, the better, but once the roux gets dark it can burn easily, so you must stir constantly and keep and eye on it.

2 While the roux is cooking, bring the 10 cups of water to a simmer. When the roux is dark enough, mix in the chopped onions, celery and green pepper and turn the heat to medium. Let this cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften. Add the garlic and cook another 1-2 minutes.

3 Add the bay leaves, the Cajun spice and slowly stir in the hot water. The roux will seize up at first, but keep stirring and it will all come together in a silky broth. Add the ham hock and all the greens. Taste for salt, but remember the ham hock will be salty, so let the broth be a little undersalted for now. If you want to add more Cajun spice, do so now. Cover the pot and simmer gently for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

4 Check the ham hock. If the meat is falling off the bone, remove it, discard the bones, chop the meat and return it to the pot. If the hock is not ready, keep simmering the gumbo; ham hocks don't always cook at the same rate. Once the hock is ready, add the andouille sausage and cook for another 15 minutes. Serve with file powder at the table.
