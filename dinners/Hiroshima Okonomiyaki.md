Hiroshima-style Okonomiyaki
===========================

Makes 4

Ingredients:
------------

Pancakes:

* 1 cup cake flour (can use AP)
* 0.75 cup dashi stock
* 0.25 cup mirin
* not a lot of dried bonito, ground into a powder

Toppings:

* 8oz cabbage, chopped into 0.5 inch square bits
* 4oz bean sprouts
* 8oz thinly sliced fresh pork belly
* 20oz yakisoba noodles
* 4 eggs
* 1/4 cup aonori

Steps:

1. Bring some water to a boil. Cook yakisoba for two minutes, until toothsome. Drain in
   collander, then rinse in cold water to stop cooking. Preheat two large skillets to
   medium-low heat.

2. Mix dashi and mirin. Slowly add to flour, mixing just enough to incorporate.

3. Make one pancake using a little less than a quarter of the batter. You're looking for a
   crepe-like thin cake about 8 inches in diameter. Make a swirly-motion thing with a
   ladle to get it all circlely. Let it cook enough to set a little, loosen it from the
   pan, then add 2oz cabbage and 1oz bean sprouts. Layer 2oz of pork on top, then dribble
   some more batter on top. Let this cook for about 4 minutes, then flip. Increase the
   heat to medium. Let the cabbage cook down, pressing down occasionally.

4. Meanwhile, start stir-frying the noodles in the other pan. After about two minutes,
   squirt some okonomiyaki sauce into the noodles with some water, and let them simmer.
   Once the pancake is done cooking, form the noodles into a disk, then transfer the
   pancake (pork down) on top of the noodles. Let cook for around 6 minutes.

5. Once the noodlecake is done, crack an egg into the now-empty first pan. Break the yolk
   and scramblefry for about 15s. Carefully transfer over the noodlecake directly on top
   of the egg. Cook for about 2m, then put a plate over skillet and flip everything so the
   okonomiyaki lands, egg-side up, on the plate.

6. Top with sauce, aonori, and kewpie.
