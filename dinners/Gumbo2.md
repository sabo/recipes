## Ingredients: 

* Coarse sea salt
* 5 lbs greens, chopped
* 1 cup peanut oil, separated into 3/4 and 1/4
* 7 garlic cloves, minced
* 3/4 cup whole wheat flour
* 2 large yellow onions, diced
* 2 large red bell peppers, diced
* 2 celery ribs, halved and chopped
* ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 10 cups vegetable stock
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme
* 1 teaspoon filé powder
* 1 tablespoon “hot” apple cider vinegar
* 2 large scallions, thinly sliced for garnish
* 1 ham hock
* 1 lb smoked andouille sausage
* 50 grams of kombu, slitted

## Instructions:

0. Pour stock into a large pot. Add kombu Bring to a boil over medium-low heat, skimming occasionally. Line a sieve with paper towels and strain into a bowel. Keep pot.

1. In a large pot, bring around 6 quarts of water to a boil. Add 2 tablespoons of salt.

2. Add leafy greens to boiling water and cook uncovered for 3-4 minutes. Drain in a collander and cool. Transfer greens to a cutting board and chop well.

3. Heat 1/4 cup in a large saute pan over medium heat and saute garlic until golden. Add the greens, raise heat to high, sprinkle with 1 teaspoon of salt, and saute, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes, until well coated with oil. Set aside.

4. In a large pot over low heat, combine flour and remaining peanut oil and cook, stirring often, until caramel colored, about 25 minutes. Add onions, bell peppers, celery, cayenne, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Raise the heat to medium and saute, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables soften, about 15 minutes. Slowly stir in the vegetable stock. Add reserved greens and ham hock, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer until greens are tender and the meat falls off the ham hock. Check after about an hour. Add the andouille sausage and cook for another 15 minutes.

5. Stir in the thyme and simmer for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in the file and the hot apple cider vinegar, and set aside to cool for 10 minutes. Serve over brown rice.
