### Notes:
The Les Halles recipe overall looks dramatically simpler than the others: no pork, no
brandy, no beef stock...being a fan of all three of those things, I'll keep them in.

I like the fact that the Macheesmo recipe strains the sauce. We'll do that too.

Serves 5-6, assuming around 1/2 lbs of meat per person.
### Ingredients:
 * Animal:
 ** 8 oz. salt pork or bacon, cut into lardons
 ** 3 lbs. beef chuck, trimmed, cut into 2 inch cubes
 * Vegetable:
 ** 8-9 shallots (around 1.5 cups chopped)
 ** 2-3 large carrots, one diced, 1-2 cut into large 2-inch chunks
 ** 5 cloves garlic, diced
 ** 2 tablespoons tomato paste
 ** 1.5 cups pearl onions
 ** 12 ounces shiitake mushrooms
 ** 1 ounce dried porcini
 * Liquids:
 ** 1 bottle pinot noir
 ** 1/2 + 2tbsp brandy
 ** 2-3 cups low-sodium beef stock
 * Herbs:
 ** 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
 ** 2 bay leaves
 ** 4 cloves
 ** 2 sprigs of thyme
 * How much butter?
 ** 6 tablespoons. 4 for the cooking, 2 for the beurre manie. Unsalted, obviously.

### Steps: 
1. Pour 1 cup of boiling water over the porcini mushrooms, and let them rehydrate.
   Chop roughly and set aside. Filter soaking water through a paper towel into a bowl and
   set aside.

2. Add salt pork or bacon to a large pan. Add enough water to just cover the lardons. Put
   over medium-high heat and cook until the water evaporates. Add 4 tablespoons of butter.
   Reduce heat to medium and cook until crispy. Add bacon to dutch oven or similar, but
   leave the fats.

3. Season beef with salt and pepper. Add beef and brown in batches over medium-high heat. 
   Take your time. Add to dutch oven.

4. Add shallots, diced carrots, and porcini to pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Add tomato paste
   and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes.

5. Add reserved soaking water. Get the *fond* in there. All them stuck cooked brown bits.
   Once the water is nearly gone, turn the heat up a bit, and add the 1/2 cup brandy. Boil
   it down a bit, and add to the dutch oven.

6. Add wine and herbs to dutch oven. Add just enough beef broth to barely cover the beef
   -- some little tips should still be poking out. Bring to a simmer and let simmer for 1
   hour.

7. Add carrot(s), and let simmer for another hour.

8. After the carrots are added, clean and trim the shiitakes and roughly chop. Prepare
   (or defrost) the pearl onions.

9. Remove beefs and carrots from the dutch oven. Strain sauce over a medium pot using a
   fine mesh strainer. Boil it down, tasting frequently. Stop if it gets too salty or
   when you have about 3 cups.

10. 15-20 minutes before you want to eat, saute the shiitakes over medium-high heat and cook
    them until they release their liquid. Add pearl onions and cook until brown. Remove
    from heat.

11. Bring sauce to a simmer. Whisk in 1/3 of the beurre manie at a time. Let it simmer and
    thicken. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of brandy.

12. Serve by coating the beef, carrots, shrooms, and onions with the sauce. Serve over a
    starch.
