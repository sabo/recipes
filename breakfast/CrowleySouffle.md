Crowley's Poor Man's Souffle

Line a deep casserole dish with a layer of bread slices spread with prepared
mustard. Alternate bread layers with grated Crowley medium sharp cheese sliced
thinly. Repeat until the bowl is full. 

Beat several eggs (as many as your conscience will allow) with sufficient milk
to flood the casserole and bake in a 350-degree oven until it balloons like a
popover. When removed from the oven, the balloon will collapse and the dish is
ready to serve.

Orig Alton Brown Cheese souffle

Ingredients

* Butter, room temperature, for greasing the souffle
* 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan
* 1 1/2 ounces (3 tablespoons) butter
* 3 tablespoons flour
* 1 teaspoon dry mustard
* 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
* 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
* 1 1/3 cups milk, hot
* 4 large egg yolks (2 1/2 ounces by weight)
* 6 ounces sharp Cheddar
* 5 egg whites plus 1 tablespoon water (5 1/2 ounces by weight plus 1/2 ounce water)
* 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar

Directions

    Use room temperature butter to grease an 8-inch souffle mold. Add the grated
    Parmesan and roll around the mold to cover the sides. Cover with plastic wrap
    and place into the freezer for 5 minutes.
    
    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.
    
    In a small saucepan, heat the butter. Allow all of the water to cook out.
    
    In a separate bowl combine the flour, dry mustard, garlic powder, and kosher
    salt. Whisk this mixture into the melted butter. Cook for 2 minutes.
    
    Whisk in the hot milk and turn the heat to high. Once the mixture reaches a
    boil, remove from the heat.
    
    In a separate bowl, beat the egg yolks to a creamy consistency. Temper the
    yolks into the milk mixture, constantly whisking. Remove from the heat and add
    the cheese. Whisk until incorporated.
    
    In a separate bowl, using a hand mixer, whip the egg whites and cream of tartar
    until glossy and firm. Add 1/4 of the mixture to the base. Continue to add the
    whites by thirds, folding very gently.
    
    Pour the mixture into the souffle. Fill the souffle to 1/2-inch from the top.
    Place on an aluminum pie pan. Bake in the oven for 35 minutes.
